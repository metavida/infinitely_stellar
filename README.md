I'm really loving [stellar.io](http://stellar.io) these days. The main thing that bugged me was the lack of infinite scrolling. Now it's easy to add via this Chrome Extension. If people have interest, I'm sure this could be ported to other platforms pretty easily (e.g. GreaseMonkey for Firefox, bookmarklet for any browser), so if you're interested in that, just ask.
